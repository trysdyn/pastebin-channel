pastebin-channel
================

Pygame app to display recently uploaded Pastebin content in a scrolling kiosk-style window.

A quick and dirty thing I hacked together at the (joking) demands of a co-worker. All it does is pop up a Pygame window that slowly scrolls new Pastebin submissions up it. Inspired by search displays at Google, which would do the same except with recent Google searches.

Definitely not something that should be used as an example of good code!

Requirements:
- Python 2.6+
- Pygame

Instructions:
Launch it! Click on the text of a paste and it'll open in your default browser. For keyboard commands, view the included help text post-launch.
